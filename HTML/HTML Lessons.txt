HTML HEADINGS: -

* HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
* There are 6 heading tags to define most important to least important.
o <h1>……</h1>
o <h2>……</h2>
o <h3>……</h3>
o <h4>……</h4>
o <h5>……</h5>
o <h6>……</h6>
* Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

HTML paragraphs: -
* A paragraph always starts on a new line, and it is usually a block of text.
* The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph
* A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph
HTML Display:
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

HTML Horizontal Rules: - 
* The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
* The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
* The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

HTML Line Breaks: -
* The HTML <br> element defines a line break
* Use <br>, if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
* The <br> tag is an empty tag as well, which means that it has no end tag.

The Poem Problem:
* Sometimes we need to display the content with spaces and new lines. Say for example: Poem
* But with usual <p> paragraph tag, the browser removes the extra spaces and the new line.
* The HTML <pre> tag helps in such conditions for preformatted text
* The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.
HTML STYLES: -
* the HTML Style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Syntax:
<tagname style = “property:value;”>
* the property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

HTML TEXT FORMATTING: -
* HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
* Formatting elements we designed to display special types of text:
o <b> - bold text
o <strong> - important text
o <i> italic text
o <em> - emphasized text
o <mark> - marked text
o <small> - smaller text
o <del> - deleted text
o <ins> - inserted text
o <sub> - subscript text
o <sup> - superscript text

HTML Quotation and Citation elements: -
* In this topic, we will go through some of the tags called <blockquote>, <q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite> and <bdo> elements.
HTML <blockquote> for Quotations:
* The HTML <blockquote> defines a section that is quoted from another source.
* Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

HTML <q> for short Quotations:
* The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
* Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations:
* The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like “HTML”, “CSS”, “Mr.”, “Dr.”, “ASAP”, “ATM”.
* Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Note: use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.

HTML <address> for Contact Information:
* The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
* The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
* The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

HTML <cite> for Work Title:
*  The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, etc.)
* The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override:
