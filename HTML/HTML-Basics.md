# HTML - Basics
**1. HTML Document Structure:**
the first and foremost basic topic while studying about HTML is HTML doucment Structure.

it is nothing but a certain template needed to be followed while creating an HTML (.html file). it consist of four parts, they are :

**1. Document Declaration**

**2. Root Element**

**3. HEAD Section**

**4. Body Section**

**Document Declaration :** Document Declaration is nothing but defining <!DOCTYPE html> as the first line of HTML document.
- Doctype will tell the browser about the page is and how to read it
- it tells the browser that, it is a HTML5 document and its version.

Why it is needed?
- without DOCTYPE, browsers may guess and switch to quirks mode (old, inconsistent rendering).
- with DOCTYPE, browsers uses standard mode (modern, consistent rendering).
- ensures your page looks the same in chrome, safari, firefox etc.
- helps your html document pass as a valid HTML 5 file.
